# Soundcloud developer challenge
This is my take on a Soundcloud developer challenge seen below

The app allow the user to manage playlists using tracks from soundcloud.
Playlists are stored in the browser using local storage.

A live version is available at http://bss.github.com/soundcloud-developer-challenge/

## SOUNDCLOUD WEB-DEV CHALLENGE

### Story
- Create a web app that allows users to create playlists of ANY tracks on SoundCloud.
- A user should be able to store, edit and delete the playlists.
- A user should be able to play all the tracks in the playlist with one click or tap.
- A user should be able to give a playlist a title and description.

### Bonuses
- Bonus points if a user can easily undo the last 100 actions.
- Bonus points if it works on latest Opera/Opera Mobile.
- Bonus points for a bookmarklet that helps you add the tracks to the playlist from SoundCloud pages.

### Requirements
- You shouldn't spend more than 2-3 evenings on this task.
- The web app can be fully client-based or have some minimal back-end/db.
- The code should be well documented.
- The code should be available on GitHub.
- The code should be hosted somewhere accessible to us (e.g. Heroku/Dropbox/Joyent/AWS).
